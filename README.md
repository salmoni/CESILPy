# CESILPy
A CESIL interpreter written in Python. CESIL is the Computer Education in Schools Instruction Language, created by ICL

It works only on the command line. Just type:

python CESILPy.py test01.ces

And the output should appear. 

### WARNING ###

There is little in the way of error checking so poor syntax will fly through.
